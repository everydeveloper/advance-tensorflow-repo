*That's right!* We need to train üèãÔ∏è our data before we test üß™ it.

Now that the model is trained to our training data, we can test it against our training data:

```
loss_value, accuracy_value = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print(f'Our test accuracy was {accuracy_value}')
>>> Our test accuracy was 0.980132
```

`model.evaluate` will evaluate how strong our model is with the test data, and report that in the form of loss value and accuracy value (since we specified `accuracy` in our `selected_metrics` variable when we compiled the model). We'll just focus on our accuracy for now. With an accuracy of ~98%, it's not perfect, but it's very accurate.
 
We can also use our model to predict specific Pok√©mon, or at least have it tell us which status the Pok√©mon is most likely to have, with `model.predict`. All it needs to predict a Pok√©mon is the data for that Pok√©mon itself. We're providing that by selecting a certain `index` of `test_data`:

```
def predictor(test_data, test_labels, index):
    prediction = model.predict(test_data)
    if np.argmax(prediction[index]) == test_labels[index]:
        print(f'This was correctly predicted to be a \"{test_labels[index]}\"!')
    else:
        print(f'This was incorrectly predicted to be a \"{np.argmax(prediction[index])}\". It was actually a \"{test_labels[index]}\".')
        return(prediction)
```

Let's look at one of the more well-known legendary Pok√©mon: Mewtwo. He's number 150 in the list of Pok√©mon, so we'll look at index 149:

```
predictor(test_data, test_labels, 149)
>>> This was correctly predicted to be a "1"!
```

Nice! It accurately predicted Mewtwo was a legendary Pok√©mon.

*Close this issue when you have a predict function that is working*
